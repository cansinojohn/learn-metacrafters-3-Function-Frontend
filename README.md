# Project: Function Frontend
## Smart Contract Management - ETH + AVAX
# Starter Next/Hardhat Project

This is a Hardhat project focusing on a simple contract with 2-3 functions that shows the values of each function
on the frontend of the application.

A starter template has been given by Metacrafters and after cloning the github, do the following to get the code running on your computer.

1. Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code
3. In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.

** This project is already modified by the author: John Cansino **

After this, the project will be running on your localhost. 
Typically at http://localhost:3000/
